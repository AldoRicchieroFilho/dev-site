# Contributing Guidelines
If you are interested in understanding the internals of GAE Studio, building from source, or contributing ideas or modifications to the project, then this document is for you.

##Licensing
All GAE Studio source and pre-built binaries are provided under the Apache 2.0 license.

##The GAE Studio Community

###Please Be Friendly
We strongly encourage everyone participating in GAE Studio development to show courtesy and respect to others. Of course, being courteous should not prevent us from constructively disagreeing with each other. But if you are enumerating 42 technical reasons against a particular proposal, please don't make the criticism worse by ridiculing the person who proposed it. State your technical disagreement freely, but respect the person you disagree with. That person may be a great learner who soon will be making the best proposals of us all.

Respectful also doesn't mean "serious". Web application development may be hard work, but it's also a lot of fun! Being lighthearted and playful is welcome. Let's enjoy being one of the friendliest communities in the whole open source movement.
